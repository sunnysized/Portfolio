                    <p>Hi there! <br>
                        My name is Sonal Patel, but everyone pretty much calls me Sunny. In May of 2018, I graduated
                        from
                        Texas Christian University with my bachelor of science in Communication Studies and a minor in
                        General Business.
                        I then went to work for a brief amount of time making the exhaustive commute from Plano to
                        Downtown Dallas
                        to work for an artificial intelligence software company that happened to work closely in the
                        automotive realm.
                        After about five to six months, I heard about the bootcamp offered through SMU to become a full
                        stack developer.
                        I was very quickly interested and found myself applying right after the new year, entering 2019.
                        Come February 25th, I was
                        officially a aprt of the Feburary cohort! Six months later, I am writing my new polished
                        portfolio, interviewing with
                        HP and Cisco, and working on the logistics of turning my project 3 assignment into a nonprofit
                        organization which will
                        change the nation. Hell, I may even get an MBA while I'm at it!</p>

                    <p>Enough about my academic and semi-professional life! The point of this page is to
                        get to know me on a personal level. So, here we go! Growing up I was a super happy-go-lucky
                        child
                        whose teachers would describe me on every report card as a "social butterfly". If you're reading
                        this
                        and you know me personally- not much of a shocker, haha. I played volleyball through middle
                        school
                        and had the best underhand serve! Overhand, though, I was best friends with the net. (If you
                        don't know
                        volleyball, you don't want your serve to go into the net- ever.) Aside from volleyball, I have
                        been
                        a dancer since I was three years old. This year, I have been dancing for 20 years
                        recreationally. I
                        competed during my high school years and won a few scholarships in LA. I am trained in ballet,
                        tap,
                        jazz, hip hop, street, contemporary, and both contact and traditional improv. Dancing has been
                        an outlet
                        for me since I could walk. As I went through my college years, I dabbled a little bit in the
                        modeling industry.
                        I have recently done a photoshoot for a boutqiue specializing in Indian attire which you can see
                        a bit at the bottom
                        of this page!
                    </p>

                    <p>So we've covered academic, semi professional, childhood, so now I dive in a bit deeper: my
                        family.
                        These are my people. My entire world. If it weren't for my dad, I probably wouldn't even been
                        writing
                        this right now. He sparked my desire for knowledge, cars, thrill seeking adventure, and is at
                        the core
                        of my silly yet strong headed personality. If you ask anyone who knows my father, after a single
                        encounter
                        with me they always say, "you two are SO alike!" And they are not wrong. I love my dad so much,
                        but at the
                        end of the day, I am mommy's girl! (Don't worry, I have a sister who's daddy's girl- we'll get
                        to her in a minute).
                        My mom is my IDOL. My dad may be at my core, but that woman is everything I strive to be. My dad
                        is my
                        foundation and my mother is who I radiate. She is the strongest woman I know, who is just like
                        me! We
                        are two peas in a pod. She is my go to person. My teacher, my guide, and not to mention the best
                        chef
                        in the world. She raised my sister and I, worked full time, and every night put a hot meal on
                        the dinner
                        table for us. She taught us how to clean the house as a team on the weekends as children, how to
                        cook
                        Indian meals that we especially liked, let us put on plays and skits we'd come up with. She was
                        present
                        and still bust her ass. She's my wonder woman... So that just leaves my baby sister. THIS GIRL
                        IS MY UNIVERSE.
                        Kailas Patel. I picked your name out before you were born. Made sure your initials were KP after
                        Kim Possible,
                        my favorite show when I was four years old. And I protected you as if I was Kim Possible too. We
                        laugh
                        more than we probably speak. We make silly sounds, we sing Ariana Grande together at the top of
                        our lungs,
                        even when I know you'd rather I not sing, haha. We played volleyball together in the yard, we've
                        done photoshoots
                        together, raised hell, and there is not a soul in the world I'd want by my side to do it all
                        with.
                        Even when life gets the best of either of us, we are each others support system. When we are
                        scared, or
                        stressed, or just need to freaking cry- we always have each others shoulder. We are each others
                        keepers,
                        and I am so proud of have you as my teammate in this life! My family is the most important group
                        of people
                        and I am pretty damn grateful for them.

                        <br><br>
                        I also have a boyfriend and a kitten. They're both ridiculously amazing, but my computer is dying so 
                        they will get their own entry at a later time! (Haha, sorry!)
