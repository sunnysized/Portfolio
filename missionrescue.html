                    <p><strong>The Facts </strong><br>
                        A person is abused in the United States every NINE seconds.<br>
                        More than 15 MILLION children witness domestic violence each year in the United States.
                        <br>Only 28% of victims report their sexual assault to the police.<br>
                        We can change these statistics.<br>
                    </p>

                    <p><strong>The Mission</strong><br>
                        We will provide an escape for victims across all forms of abuse. From domestic abuse, physical
                        abuse,
                        sexual abuse, child abuse and neglect we will show these victims support and give them a safe
                        place to
                        come for help.
                        The mission is to educate and provide help. To extend a hand to someone who needs our support
                        where
                        they may not have it elsewhere. Our website may be the first place a survivor feels couragous
                        enough to
                        seek outside help.
                        Our mission is to be a voice to those who feel muted. Our goal is to rescue victims and support
                        them.
                        Because after all they have been through, while they see themselves as victims, as hurt and
                        scared...
                        we will see them as <strong>survivors.</strong>
                    </p>


                    <p><strong>Functionality</strong><br>
                        Users will access the site via a button which can be imbedded onto any
                        website. Upon access to the site, the user will be prompted with a login/sign
                        up page. Once granted permission to the site various tabs of imformation are
                        available for the user to explore. If the user feels uncomfortable or in
                        danger of someone watching over their shoulder there is a double click
                        escape where the user can double click anywhere on the window and the window
                        will switch from our site to google and pinterest. On the home page there are
                        six tabs: Our Cause, About Us, In Home, Out of Home, Worried about Others, and Advocating
                        for Minors. Each tab will go in further detail of their respected topic. In the future we'd like
                        to
                        have LMSW's work for us as volunteers to provide immediate help via chat options that will be
                        implemented
                        in future versions of the website. In addition, we'd like to add a section on Title IX as well
                        as
                        offer talks in high schools to inform these individuals going through prominent developmental
                        stages
                        of their lives so that those statistics above, especially the 28% of sexual abuse victims, will
                        increase
                        when it comes to reporting their encounters to the police. </p>
